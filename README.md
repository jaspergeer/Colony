# Colony
 An Evolution Simulator (WIP)

Colony lets you easily observe the processes of mutation and natural selection!
The user can vary the temperature, type of food, and abundance of food, and see the effects on the traits of a simulated population.
This is not meant as an accurate scientific demonstration but instead as an accessible way to display the process of evolution!
Feel free to use as an educational tool or just for fun, download links coming soon.

# Builds
