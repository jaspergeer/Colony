# Colony
An Graphical Evolution Simulator

Colony lets you easily observe the processes of mutation and natural selection!
The user can vary the temperature, type of food, and abundance of food, and see the effects on the traits of a simulated population.
If you are feeling especially malevolent, unleash a virus upon your colony and see how they adapt and evolve.
